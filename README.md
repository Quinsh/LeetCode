## Diary / Comments:

**07/10/2024 [16:44] (169 solved)** - ahhh after suffering with Trees and Recursion, Merge Sort is so easy. Just tried to implemented Merge Sort and it was very relaxing. Problem solving is very stressful, especially when you don't see quickly the result of your effort.
**07/31/2024 [13:25] (216 solved)** - I'm still exploring general topics. Rn stuck on DP - I can't still grasp it intuitively. Seems like DP has large range of question types, which make me less confident for being able to solve certain DP questions on my own. I'll solve like 30 more questions on DP and go to Graphs.
