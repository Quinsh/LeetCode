## Diary / Comments:

07/10/2024 [16:44] (169 solved) - ahhh after suffering with Trees and Recursion so much, Merge Sort is so easy. Just tried to implemented Merge Sort and it was very relaxing. Problem solving is very stressful, especially when you don't see quickly the result of your effort. I also need to finish studying C++ basics. I don't know C++ very well.
